# LM
Launch Manager is a standalone js/html/css app designed to launch webistes inside of your browser designed to look like a desktop environment. Sure you can just launch windows directy from your favorite browser but with Launch Manager you can launch mulitple site simultaneoulsy and since LM is able to track window position and size you come back to the same dimensional state you left it at even if the browser is restarted. You can move windows around, resize them, minimize, maximize, and more. 

Launch Manager was originally geared towards remote access through a browser without the needs for tabs. It can of course launch any site that allows it to be shown in an iframe. Please note that many sites such a any of the Google sites, Apple, Mircosoft, and more, do not allow themselves to be shown in an iframe.

The true purpose of LM was actually to give TMM_desktop.js (included here) a real life work out.

## Usage
Launch the file lm.html (found in LM directory) in a browser.
